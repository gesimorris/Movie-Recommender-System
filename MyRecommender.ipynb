    "In this notebook, we have seen two collaborative filtering methods, memory based and model based. **Memory-based models** are based on similarity between items or users, where we use cosine-similarity. **Model-based CF** is based on matrix factorization where we use SVD to factorize the matrix. SVD in recommender systems leverages matrix factorization to break down the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors. These factors are then used to predict missing ratings and make personalized recommendations by capturing the underlying relationships in user preferences and item characteristics. This approach is particularly effective in handling large and sparse datasets, making it a cornerstone of modern recommender systems.However, if little data is provided, this method becomes less effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve on this system, implementing a user interface which displays the recommended movies would be the next step. There are also many other methods to get the recommendations. By impementing them as well, I can see which method gives the most accurate recommendations"
